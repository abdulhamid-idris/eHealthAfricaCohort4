        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at <strong>0</strong>. Can’t <em>talk</em>, can’t <em>walk</em>, certainly can’t <em>do algebra.</em> <br>
        <em>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike</em>. Nobody’s good at <strong>anything</strong> at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are <em>born to learn.</em><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You <em>stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall</em>.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you <strong>walk</strong>.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger</strong>.<br>
        <em>Failing is just another word for growing</em>. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <strong>basic ideas</strong> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong> You can learn anything</strong>.
